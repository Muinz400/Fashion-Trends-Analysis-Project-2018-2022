Fashion Trends Analysis (2018–2022)

Overview
This project analyzes fashion sales data (2018–2022) using SQL, Tableau, and Python.

The goal was to uncover customer preferences, seasonal patterns, and the impact of discounts while practicing end-to-end data analytics:
-SQL (Postgres): database design and queries

-Tableau Public: interactive dashboards for storytelling.

-Python (Pandas/Jupyter): validation and extra analysis.


Tech Stack
-Database: PostgreSQL

-Querying: SQL (joins, CTEs, window functions)

-Visualization: Tableau Public

-Scripting: Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)


Analysis & Insights

Q1. Seasonal Fashion Trends

Question: Which product categories dominate in each season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)? Do customer preferences shift depending on the season?

Analysis:
-Shirts, Shorts, and Skirts peak in Summer.

-Jackets and Dresses lead during Winter and Fall.

-Strong evidence of seasonal shifts in customer demand.


Q2. Product Category Performance

Question: Which categories generate the highest total sales and ratings?

Analysis:
-Shoes, Dresses, and Jackets show the strongest performance in sales volume.

-Categories like Blouses underperform, signaling niche demand.

Q3. Do Discounts Actually Boost Sales?

Question: Is there a correlation between higher discounts and higher sales?

Analysis:
-Moderate discounts (10–20%) boost sales most effectively.

-Discount strategy should focus on value perception rather than markdown depth.


Q4. Optimal Product Mix (High Sales + High Ratings)

Question: Which products balance both high sales and strong customer satisfaction?

Analysis:
-Beach Shirts and Biker Jackets emerge as “hero products.”

-These products combine volume (sales) with quality (ratings).

-They should be prioritized in marketing & stock management.


Q5. Year-over-Year Trend Analysis

Question: How have total sales changed year-over-year, and which categories grew the most?

Analysis:
